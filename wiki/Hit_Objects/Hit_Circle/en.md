# Hit Circle

![A hit circle in the default skin.](img/Hit_circle.png "A hit circle in the default skin.")

Hit circles, or "hit markers" in the DS games, are coloured circles with a number on them that shows its place in a combo. These are outlined with another circle (the approach circle) shrinking around it. Once the approach circle outline overlaps the hit circle's border, the player should click on/tap the hit circle, earning a set number of points (50, 100, or 300) based on how accurate they were (e.g. if they clicked too early, their points would be reduced). Tapping regular hit circles gives a very small boost to the life bar, and at the end of a combo a bigger boost will be awarded if the player did well in that combo.
