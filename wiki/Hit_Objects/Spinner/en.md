# Spinner

![A spinner in the default skin.](img/Spinner.jpg "A spinner in the default skin.")

A spinner is a circle that takes up the entire play area. Below the spinner is a number showing the spins per minute (RPM). The player should hold the mouse or keyboard button down and spin in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. As long as the mouse button is held down, the cursor is locked on the Spinnerâ€™s area, so the player need not worry about going outside it. Once the player has spun for a while (dependent on the difficulty and length of the spinner), the spinner will be cleared, glowing white. Any continuous spins after this will award 1000-point bonuses per approximate spin. Spinning a spinner provides a continuous minor boost to the Life Bar depending on the spinning speed.

Note: The superseded default skin (osu!default by peppy) has a different variant of spinner. In this, there is an approach circle to the spinner and on either side of the spinner there are spinner bars. The player must spin to fill them up before the spinner is completed.
