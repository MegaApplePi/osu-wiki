# osu!api v2

Version 2 of the osu!api is in the works at [osu-web](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web), and it aims to be much more robust than the original. Documentation (not guaranteed to be up-to-date) can be found on its [reference page](https://docs.ppy.sh).

Authentication for the new API follows the [OAuth 2 protocol](https://oauth.net/2/). Clients can be managed via the [account settings page](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit).
